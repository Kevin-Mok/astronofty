Astronofty is an NFT marketplace to create/buy/sell 
astrophotography. This project was created for UofTHacks 
where it came in [2nd 
overall](https://devpost.com/software/astronofty). You can 
view a demo of it [here](https://youtu.be/fRc4_yx4ONE).

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from my passion for decentralized technology.  
One particular niche of decentralization 
I am particularly fond of is NFT's and how they 
can become a great income stream for artists. 
With the theme of the hackathon being 
exploration and showing a picture of a rocket 
ship, it is no surprise that the idea of space 
came to mind. Looking into space photography, I 
found the [r/astrophotography](https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophotography/) 
subreddit that has a community of 2.6 million members. 
There, beautiful shots of space can be found, 
but they also require expensive equipment and 
precise editing. My idea for Astronofty is to 
turn these photographs into NFT's for the users 
to be able to sell as unique tokens on the 
platform while using Estuary as decentralized 
storage platform for the photos.

## What It Does
You can mint/create NFT's of your astrophotography to sell to other users. 

## How I Built It
- Frontend: React
- Transaction Pipeline: Solidity/MetaMask
- Photo Storage: Estuary

## Challenges I Ran Into
I wanted to be able to upload as many images as you want to a single NFT so figuring that out logistically, structurally and synchronously in React was a challenge.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
Deploying a fully functional all-in-one NFT marketplace.

## What I Learned
I learned about using Solidity mappings and 
structs to store data on the blockchain and all 
the frontend/contract integrations needed to 
make an NFT marketplace work.

## What's Next for Astronofty
A mechanism to keep track of highly sought after photographers.
